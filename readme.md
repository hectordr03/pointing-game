#Pointing Game

##### Technology used:
I used very simple JS and HTML/CSS.
* I was lot more comfortable with Grid/Flex.
* Keyframes and animations were used.

##### Approach:
I wrote out functions and made it playable in console first. This helped me stay focused on how I wanted the game to play.

##### Unsolved Problems:
* I wanted to implement an arrow with a slam animation that happnes when a player clicks on their choice.
    - I created the slam animation and imported the arrow images. I was unable to get them to perform the animation on the center of the screen on button press.

* Characters sliding into position.
    - I wanted to make a sliding animation onclick of the "OK" button on the rules div. I'm sure this is do-able but I ran out of time.

* Power-ups:
    - I wanted to include power-ups, like removing two options from button choices or something of that manner if the player wins some of rounds in a row.
